    <p2>I’m an interdisciplinary designer skilled in print, web, branding and graphic design. I love design, especially in what it can offer to problems we encounter everyday, and enjoy design as a strategy, applied in the solution of these problems. </p2>

    <p2>In 2017 I completed my 4 years study at Massey University in Wellington, gaining a bachelor degree with honors in Visual Communication Design.  In this time some of the things i'm proud to have accomplished include an exchange semester to Germany at Hochschule München in 2016 and attending dutch design design week in Eindhoven. 
    
        <br><br>
        
    This experience influenced my final year project, 'Adrift' which focused on travel and cultural adjustment. I was also privileged to attend the Best Awards in 2017 and win a gold for 'the Dark Side of Fashion' which I worked on with Luke Hoban.</p2>
